# Push_Swap

## 📜 Description
"Push_Swap" is a challenging algorithmic project from 42 School. The goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations, aiming to minimize the number of moves required. This project enhances your understanding of sorting algorithms, data structures, and algorithm optimization.

## 🌟 Features
- Efficiently sort a stack of integers
- Limited and defined operations
- Optimization of moves
- Comprehensive algorithm analysis

## ⚙️ Installation

To clone and compile this project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yvann-ba/Push_Swap.git
cd Push_Swap
make
```
## 🚀 Usage
To sort a stack of integers, execute the following command:
```
./push_swap "3 2 1"
```
Replace "3 2 1" with any sequence of integers. The program will output the steps to sort the stack
